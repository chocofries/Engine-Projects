ASTRONOMAD | A MINIMALIST SPACE RTS


||HOW TO PLAY||

Colonize planets from your mothership, then expand to and exterminate the enemy's home
planet to win! Be careful as the enemy will want to expand its territories as well!

Use your minion-sized swarmling units to colonize and attack other planets! You can
use them as bullets, but also as shields for your planets, talk about versatile!

The swarmlings spawn periodically on your colonized planets, so the more planets you
have the more swarmlings you can get!

Unfortunately intergalatic law prohibits firing upon enemy motherships, but blowing up
their colonies is free game! So do it whenever you can!

Remember to save a couple of swarmlings to defend your home planet, otherwise you'll be
out of the space-real-esatate business faster than you can say space-real-estate business!

More importantly, remember to have fun!
